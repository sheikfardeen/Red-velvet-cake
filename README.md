# Red-velvet-cake
 Red velvet cake is a layered red-colored cake with a white icing and a subtle chocolate flavor. The cake contains such a small amount of cocoa, somewhere in the range of 2 to 3 tablespoons per 2Â½ cups flour, that it really does not taste like a chocolate cake.
 When a recipe for red velvet cake calls for cocoa powder, it means natural or unprocessed unsweetened cocoa powder, and not Dutch processed cocoa. Natural cocoa, unlike Dutch processed cocoa, contains the acidity that is needed to react with baking soda to make the cake rise. To help this process along, buttermilk, which is also acidic, is added in most recipes.
